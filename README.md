About
-----
I created this for two reasons:
1. my little brother always beats me in this card game.
2. i was interested in its mathematical properties.

Dependencies
------------
None, only standard Python libraries.

Usage
-----
In main.py, you can change `n_games`, `N_ATTRIBUTES`, and `N_VARIATIONS` and just run it to see what happens.

There are also some additional files and depracated code where I tried other approaches, but this functional one was the one I was most happy with, so that's the one where all the fun stuff is.
